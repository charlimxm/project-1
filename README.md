### Overview
In the recent spate of bad news, Yishun was named home to one of Singapore's most dystopian societies. Not all is bad when it was revealed that newly elected President, Mdm Halimah Yacob is a Yishunite (short for people who resides in Yishun).

Can you help Halimah help to reclaim Yishunâ€™s disastrous reputation?
